# KIKstart Collaborative Metadata Lab Series

## Introduction
The KIKStart Metadata Lab series happens every 2nd wednesday of the month. The goal of the lab
is to work on metadata related issues in non demanding way. 

## Schedule
### 12 February 2025
This is the first edition of the KIKstart Metadata Lab Series.
Presenter: Andra Waagmeester
Topic: Introduction to persistent URI's

We will start with a short introduction to persistent URI's and why they are important. This will be
in a playful way using [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) and the [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org) tool.

#### Learning objectives
* Understand the importance of persistent URI's
* Understand the Wikimedia ecosystem as the means to link media, text and data.
* Understand ORCID's as persistent identifiers for researchers.
* Understand ROR's as persistent identifiers for research organizations.
* Understand DOI's as persistent identifiers for publications.

#### Preparation
Participants are cordially invited to create the following accounts:
* [ORCID](https://orcid.org/signin)
* [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount)

It is not necessary to have these accounts, but it will make the lab more interactive. 
Registration for these accounts during the KIKstart Metadata Lab is in principle possible, but 
will be limited to only a few. Both services put a limit on the number of accounts that can be created daily from a
single organisation.
